protobuf-net MonoTouch example. Uses self compiled v2 beta r470 assembly on iOS and 
pre-built r450 assemblies for the Windows side. All assemblies are under the
Assemblies folder.

The serialization assembly is created using solution in Windows. It gets saved
to Assemblies/Any folder and is under source code control.

This sample currently only works on the simulator. It does not work on the iOS
device. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7940838/jit-compile-error-with-protobuf-net-on-monotouch-ios-device-iphone-ipad.
