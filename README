protobuf-net MonoTouch example. Uses v2 beta r450 (binary distribution) asemblies, 
which are buncled in the Assemblies folder.

The serialization assembly is created using solution in Windows. It gets saved
to Assemblies/Any folder and is under source code control.

This sample currently only works on the simulator. It does not work on the iOS
device. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7940838/jit-compile-error-with-protobuf-net-on-monotouch-ios-device-iphone-ipad.
